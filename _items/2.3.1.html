title: Set opening paragraphs flush left

<blockquote class='quote-from-book'>	<p><span class='ic'>“</span>The function of a paragraph indent is to mark a pause, setting the paragraph apart from what precedes it. If a paragraph is preceded by a title or subhead, the indent is superfluous and can therefore be omitted.”</p>
 </blockquote>
	<p>Paragraphs, and other block level elements, are indented using the <code>text-indent</code> property. To ensure a paragraph is set flush left, the text-indent should be set to&nbsp;zero:</p>

<pre><code>p {
  text-indent: 0;
}</code></pre>

	<p>This rule is rarely necessary, however, because <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> specifies that the default initial value for <code>text-indent</code> should be <code>0</code>.</p>
