	<p>Hair spaces and thin spaces are two of the many <a href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/general_punctuation.html" title="General Punctuation - Test for Unicode support in Web browsers">space characters available in Unicode</a>. Even if the character itself isn’t included in the current font, Unicode-aware browsers will display a good approximation. Here’s how to use hair spaces and thin spaces,&nbsp;respectively:</p>


<pre><code>W.&amp;#8202;B. Yeats
J.&amp;#8201;C.&amp;#8201;L. Prillwitz</code></pre>

	<p>Which renders as W.&#8202;B. Yeats and J.&#8201;C.&#8201;L. Prillwitz. Unfortunately some browsers which are less Unicode-aware will show square placeholder symbols instead of the required spaces, so until support improves, no space at all is probably the way to go in this&nbsp;instance.</p>
